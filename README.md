**1. Prediction for children height**

This project is a modification from the prerequisite assignment for the deep-learning bootcamp from the Erdos Institute.

I carried out exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, feature selection, and performed simple linear regression model to predict the height of a child. I examined whether interaction terms and regularization are needed in the fitting. Also, I used a logistic regression to predict the sex of the child if his/ her height is given. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve are employed to assess the logistic model.
